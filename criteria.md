#criteria for *candidate* documents

- if not exceeding 50 lines: Markdown format
- otherwise LaTeX, in order to generate PDF & EPUB files. LyX was used up until now, with a few specific parameters (such as the "article (book)" class) which can be found in each document's preamble.
- english language
- relevance of content, technically and (with exceptions) economically
- all the documents's source files in the same folder as the document itself
