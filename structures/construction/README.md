- Dome software ([dome48.tar.gz] (http://www.senecass.com/software/dome48.tar.gz)), description: *This is a version of Richard J. Bono's Dome program, version 4.8. Although the Unix port was already done, I tweaked things to (like adding a real Makefile) so it would build on my Linux system. This program will generate a DXF or POV file, describing the geometry of a dome skin.*
