###description (Dome software)

This is a version of Richard J. Bono's Dome program, version 4.8. Although the Unix port was already done, I tweaked things to (like adding a real Makefile) so it would build on my Linux system. This program will generate a DXF or POV file, describing the geometry of a dome skin.
