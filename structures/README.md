Wikipedia articles on some aspects of this field:

- [Structural_engineer] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineer)
- [Structural_system] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_system)
- [Structural_engineering] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineering)
- [Non-building_structure] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-building_structure)

this is one of OSHWL's big categories that aren't easy to define. this also applies to its sub-categories:

- assemblies (typically structures that don't fit into the "construction" sub-category, such as mechanisms)
- construction (the idea behind it: [Construction] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction), [Construction_engineering] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_engineering))

just a sidenote (really nothing more): caught my attention but not read or included to OSHWL yet:
