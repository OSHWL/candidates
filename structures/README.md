Wikipedia articles on some aspects of this field:

- [Structural_system] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_system)
- [Structural_engineering] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineering)
- [Structural_engineer] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineer)
- [Non-building_structure] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-building_structure)

this is one of OSHWL's big categories that aren't easy to define. such unclarity also applies to *structures*' sub-categories:

- *construction* (the idea behind it: [Construction] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction), [Construction_engineering] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_engineering))
- *assemblies*: structures that don't qualify for the *construction* sub-category

just a sidenote (really nothing more): caught my attention but not read or included to OSHWL yet:
