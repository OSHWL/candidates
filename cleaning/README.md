the idea (wikipedia articles):

- [Cleaning] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cleaning)
- [Washing] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing)
- [Category:Cleaning_products] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cleaning_products)
- [Category:Cleaning_tools] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cleaning_tools)
- [Parts_cleaning] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_cleaning)

this OSHW category may not be the first one would think about, but convincing arguments to withdraw it remain to be presented.

although rather considered "application oriented" OSHW projects ("making something open source that cleans"), they may also be used as intermediates for OSHW projects that belong to other categories ("cleaning OSHW").

the sub-categories could be grouped as follows:

- cleaning how/with what:
	
	- cleaning agents
	- vacuum
	
- cleaning what:
	
	- our bodies
	- dishes
	- our environment
	- laundry

a few related concepts are developed under water/plumbing and water/treatment.

custom brushes (e.g. when special shapes and/or sizes are desired) may be of interest:
