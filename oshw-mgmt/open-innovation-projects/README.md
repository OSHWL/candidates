"oip-energy" and "oip-selected-content" were started as complements, using data from OIP and a litlle bit from elsewhere, too. they are meant to better show the who's who in OSHW generally (that's "oip-selected-content" but is quite vast and loses clarity) and in the OSHW "energy" field (that's "oip-energy").
