this is also one of OSHWL's big categories that were not easy to define. it should have two sub-categories (only has the second as folder, for now):

- robotics
- manufacturing

those were kind of merged because many OSHW projects qualify for both (achieve the latter through the first).

in case you haven't realized yet, this is where the iconic "3D printing" fits in (see /manuf/additive).
