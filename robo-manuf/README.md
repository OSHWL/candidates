#*robo-manuf*: Robotics and manufacturing techniques

this is also one of OSHWL's big categories that were not easy to define. it has two sub-categories:

- robotics
- manufacturing techniques

even though they are clearly different concepts, those were grouped because many OSHW projects tend to qualify for both (achieve the latter through the first, like the iconic "3D printing": see /manuf/additive).
