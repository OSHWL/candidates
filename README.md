#OSHWL *candidate* documents

**... which have not yet been ["selected"](http://oshwl.github.io/SELECTION), please improve them or add new ones!**

it would be nice to have the documents meet the following criteria:
- if not exceeding 50 lines: Markdown format
- otherwise LaTeX, in order to generate PDF & EPUB files
- english language
- relevance of content, technically and (with exceptions) economically
- all the documents's source files in the same folder as the document itself
